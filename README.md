# odin-RockPaperScissors
 
Project completed for The Odin Project's Foundations course: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors

## Features
- Shiny design with glass tables as stages for each round
- Emulates "Rock...Paper...Scissors...Shoot!" chanting experience, building up to each decision
- See all previous round outcomes
- Supports touch & mouse input

## Todos & Known Issues
- Sometimes clicking/touching outside of choices can progress to "Shoot!" chant, preventing access to next round
- New rounds appear in a disorienting way. Before users can see results of previous round, the new round takes its spot. Solution: Show "Next Round" button after a round completes instead of suddenly showing the next round automatically.
